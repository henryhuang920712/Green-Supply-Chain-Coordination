# Introduction

This repository serves as a tutorial for implementing the Green Supply Chain Coordination Approach, inspired by the concepts outlined in the paper "Balancing price and green quality in the presence of consumer environmental awareness: a green supply chain coordination approach" authored by Jafar Heydari, Kannan Govindan & Zahra Basiri (2021). We developed this tutorial as a hands-on application for the course "Operations Research Applications and Implementation" instructed by Professor Chia-Yen Lee.

# The Model

In the proposed model, various assumptions are taken into account. Some assumptions enhance the model's realism, while others are employed for simplification. To establish a sound mathematical model, it is assumed that:

- **Single Period Setting:** The channel operates within a single period, indicating that transactions and interactions occur within a specific timeframe.
- **Environmental Awareness of Customers:** Customers in the channel possess environmental tendencies and the ability to recognise the environmental quality of the offered products.
- **Customer Sensitivity to Price:** The sensitivity of customers to price is known. Additionally, the level of Consumer Environmental Awareness (CEA) within the customer community is presumed to be measured previously through survey methods.
- **Symmetric Information Sharing:** For simplicity reasons it is considered that all the model parameters are known to both channel members, implying symmetric information sharing between them.
- **Deterministic Demand Function:** The demand function is deterministic and assumed to follow a linear relationship with the selling price and the greenness level of the product.
- **Static Pricing Scheme:** Due to the nature of the product and the business environment, a static pricing scheme is employed in the studied Supply Chain (SC). This suggests that the pricing strategy remains constant over the studied period.
- The **notation** used in this tutorial is as follows:

## Model Description

The optimal solutions are derived under different scenarios: (1) centralised scenario, (2) decentralised scenario, (3) coordination scenario via contracts.
